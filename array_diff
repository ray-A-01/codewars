# Kata Description: "Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference
# function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.
# It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b
# keeping their order.
# array_diff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
# If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from
# the other:
# array_diff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]"

def array_diff(a, b):
    return [val for val in a if val in (set(a) - set(b))]
